# Virtual Assistant

### This is a virtual assistant that can perform various tasks based on what speech input you give.

</br>

### List of Commands:

- say ```'play'``` followed by a song name or an artist's name (for example: ```play Lithium by Nirvana```). This will open a new tab in your default browser and play that particular song on YouTube.

- say ```'who is'``` followed by a person's name (for example: ```who is Donald Trump```). The assistant will fetch information from Wikepedia and read it aloud.

- say ```'what's the time?'```. The assistant will speak out the current time for you.

   (I'll be adding more commands to this list)
